# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# Refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the PostgreSQL
# documentation for a complete description of this file.  A short
# synopsis follows.
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.  Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html

# listen_addresses = '*'

{% for client in postgresql_hba_entries %}
{{ client.type }} {{ client.database }} {{ client.user }} {{ client.address|default('') }} {{ client.ip_address|default('') }} {{ client.ip_mask|default('') }} {{ client.auth_method }} {{ client.auth_options|default("") }}
